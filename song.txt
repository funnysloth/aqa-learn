On the field we stand, united we play,
With every pass and goal, we seize the day.
In the stadium's roar, we feel the heat,
Football's the rhythm that makes our hearts beat.

Oh, this beautiful game, we live and we fight,
Through the highs and lows, our spirits ignite.
From the pitch to the stands, we're one big team,
In the game of football, we chase our dream.
